## CI Automations and Alerts

See [claude-skills/AUTOMATIONS.md](claude-skills/AUTOMATIONS.md) for the
source-of-truth inventory of:

- portable scheduled automations and their destinations;
- systemd services, timers, schedules, credentials, and persistent state;
- installation, failover, validation, and operational commands;
- host-local automations that are not portable yet;
- investigation skills that do not run on a schedule.

## How CI Works

When a commit is pushed to the [vLLM repository](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), a Buildkite webhook triggers a new build. The pipeline is dynamically generated based on the changes in the commit.

### Pipeline Generation

#### Pipeline Generator (primary — CUDA/CPU CI, Intel CI)

A Python tool (`buildkite/pipeline_generator/`) that reads step definitions from YAML files in the vLLM repo (e.g. `.buildkite/test_areas/`, `.buildkite/image_build/`), groups them, and converts them into Buildkite YAML with proper agent queues, Docker/Kubernetes plugins, and environment configuration.

**How it runs:** The bootstrap step installs `pipeline-generator` from ci-infra (`pip install git+...ci-infra.git@main#subdirectory=buildkite/pipeline_generator`) and invokes it with the vLLM repo's `.buildkite/ci_config.yaml`. The `VLLM_CI_BRANCH` environment variable controls which ci-infra branch to install from (defaults to `main`).

**Config:** Driven by a YAML config file (`ci_config.yaml`) that specifies job directories, registries, repositories, and `run_all_patterns`. See the [pipeline generator README](buildkite/pipeline_generator/README.md) for details.

**Features:**
- **Device types**: CPU, GPU (L4), A100, H100, H200, H200 18GB (MIG), B200, GH200, Intel CPU/HPU/GPU, ARM CPU, Ascend NPU, AMD MI250/MI325/MI355 (1-8 devices)
- **Plugin generation**: Docker plugin for EC2-based queues, Kubernetes pod specs for H100/H200/A100
- **AMD mirroring**: Steps can define `mirror.amd` to automatically create parallel AMD test runs
- **Source file dependencies**: Steps can specify which source files they depend on for intelligent test filtering
- **Block steps**: Optional tests are gated behind manual approval blocks
- **Variable injection**: Automatically injects registry URLs and image references into step commands

#### Jinja2 Template (AMD CI)

`buildkite/test-template-amd.j2` renders vLLM's [`test-pipeline.yaml`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/.buildkite/test-pipeline.yaml) into Buildkite YAML using [minijinja-cli](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja).

### Bootstrap Scripts

| Script | Pipeline | Generation Method |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| `bootstrap-intel.sh` | Intel CI | Pipeline generator (via ci-infra) |
| `bootstrap-amd.sh` | AMD/ROCm CI | Jinja2 template (`test-template-amd.j2`) |

The AMD and Intel bootstrap scripts additionally handle:
- **Diff detection**: Computes changed files vs. `origin/main` (PRs) or `HEAD~1` (main branch).
- **Docs-only skip**: If all changes are in `docs/`, `*.md`, or `mkdocs.yaml`, CI is skipped entirely.
- **Run-all detection**: Changes to critical files (`Dockerfile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `csrc/`, `setup.py`, `requirements/*.txt`) trigger all tests and build wheels from source.
- **Precompiled wheels**: When no critical files changed, precompiled wheels from the merge-base commit are used if available at `wheels.vllm.ai`.
- **PR labels**: `ready-run-all-tests` forces all tests including optional/nightly. `ci-no-fail-fast` disables fail-fast mode.
- **ECR cache resolution**: Resolves multi-layer cache sources with a fallback chain (PR-specific -> base branch -> main).

## Infrastructure

### AWS (Primary)

Managed via Terraform in `terraform/aws/`. Uses the [Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws) (v6.21.0) to deploy autoscaling agent clusters as CloudFormation stacks.

**Regions**: us-west-2 (GPU + CPU queues), us-east-1 (CPU build queues with warm-cache AMI, release queues)

#### Agent Queues

| Queue | Instance Type | Max | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|-----|---------|
| `small_cpu_queue_premerge` | r6in.large | 40 | Bootstrap, docs, lightweight tasks |
| `medium_cpu_queue_premerge` | r6in.4xlarge | 40 | Medium CPU workloads |
| `cpu_queue_premerge` | r6in.16xlarge (512GB) | 10 | CUDA kernel compilation |
| `cpu_queue_premerge_us_east_1` | r6in.16xlarge (512GB) | 20 | CPU builds (warm-cache AMI) |
| `arm64_cpu_queue_premerge` | r7g.16xlarge | 10 | ARM64 builds |
| `gpu_1_queue` | g6.4xlarge (1x L4) | 208 | Single-GPU tests |
| `gpu_4_queue` | g6.12xlarge (4x L4) | 64 | Multi-GPU tests |

Equivalent postmerge and release queues exist with ECR write access for pushing images. Specialized hardware (H100, H200, B200, A100) is managed via Kubernetes or dedicated pools.

**Each queue consists of:**
- An EC2 Auto Scaling Group that scales instances based on workload
- A Lambda function that polls Buildkite to assess capacity needs
- Buildkite agents running on each instance, executing jobs in Docker containers
- All on-demand (100%), terminated after each job for isolation

#### AWS Resources

- **VPC**: Isolated networks in us-west-2 and us-east-1 (10.0.0.0/16, 4 public subnets each)
- **ECR**: `vllm-ci-test-cache` (PR builds) and `vllm-ci-postmerge-cache` (main branch) with 14-day lifecycle
- **S3**: `vllm-build-sccache` for C++ compiler cache, `vllm-wheels` / `vllm-wheels-dev` for wheel binaries
- **Secrets Manager**: HuggingFace token, Buildkite analytics token
- **SSM Parameter Store**: Agent tokens, AMI IDs

### GCP

- **GKE** (`terraform/gcp/`): Kubernetes clusters in us-central1 and us-west1 with L4 GPU node pools (g2-standard machines, up to 64 nodes). Autopilot cluster available. Artifact registry with 7-day cleanup. Compute instance groups for CPU builders.
- **TPU** (`terraform/gcp_old/`): TPU infrastructure across multiple GCP projects:
  - **TPU v5**: v5litepod-1 nodes for CI testing
  - **TPU v6e**: v6e-1 and v6e-8 nodes with hyperdisk-balanced storage
  - **TPU v7x**: v7x-2 and v7x-8 nodes with up to 4TB disk
  - **CPU**: e2-standard-2 and n2-standard-64 instances for CPU-only workloads
  - **Monitoring**: e2-micro instances running buildkite-agent-metrics exporter with GCP Ops Agent

### Kubernetes

The `infra-k8s/` directory provides Helm-based deployment of the [Buildkite Agent Stack for Kubernetes](https://github.com/buildkite/agent-stack-k8s). Used for specialized hardware (A100, H100, H200, B200) where the pipeline generator creates Kubernetes pod specs with GPU resource requests, node selectors, and shared storage mounts (EFS/FSx for model weights).

## Caching Strategy

Build performance relies on a multi-layer caching approach:

### Docker Layer Cache (BuildKit + ECR)

The bootstrap script resolves cache sources with a fallback chain:

1. **PR-specific cache**: `vllm-ci-test-cache:pr-{number}`
2. **Base branch cache**: Cache from the PR's target branch
3. **Main branch cache**: `vllm-ci-postmerge-cache:latest`

Cache is stored as registry refs in private ECR repositories with 14-day expiration.

### Warm-Cache AMI

A daily Buildkite pipeline (`.buildkite/pipelines/rebuild-cpu-ami.yml`, scheduled at 3 AM PST) builds custom EC2 AMIs with pre-warmed Docker layer caches:

1. **Build AMI**: Packer creates an AMI from the Buildkite Elastic Stack base, installs BuildKit as a standalone systemd service (not docker-container driver), and pre-pulls the latest postmerge Docker image layers using the bake config artifact from the most recent CI build.
2. **Update SSM**: Stores the new AMI ID in AWS SSM Parameter Store.
3. **Update Launch Templates**: Creates new EC2 Launch Template versions for premerge, postmerge, and release CPU queues, then updates Auto Scaling Groups. Existing instances cycle out naturally (`TerminateInstanceAfterJob=true`).
4. **Cleanup**: Retains the 3 most recent old AMIs for rollback, deletes older ones and their snapshots.

The warm-cache AMI is used by the `cpu_queue_*_us_east_1` queues and release queues.

### sccache

C++ compilation outputs are cached in S3 (`vllm-build-sccache` in us-west-2), configured via `docker/ci.hcl`.

### Precompiled Wheels

When no critical source files have changed, CI uses precompiled wheels from the merge-base commit (hosted at `wheels.vllm.ai`) instead of building from source.

## GitHub Runner Groups

The `github/` directory contains Terraform configurations for GitHub Actions runner groups used by partner organizations:

- **Neural Magic** (`group-neural-magic/`): Dedicated runner group for Neural Magic workloads.
- **IBM** (`group-ibm/`): Dedicated runner group for IBM workloads.

These are deployed with `terraform apply` and require a GitHub PAT with organizational admin permissions.

## Development

### Testing Changes

1. Create a feature branch on this repo (contact @khluu for access if needed).
2. Push your changes to the branch.
3. Create a new build on Buildkite with the environment variable:
   ```
   VLLM_CI_BRANCH=my-feature-branch
   ```
   This tells the bootstrap script to fetch templates/code from your branch instead of `main`.

**Notes:**
- Run builds on your own vLLM feature branch/fork, preferably up-to-date with `main`.
- For fork branches, use the full commit hash (not `HEAD`) and format the branch name as `<fork/username>:<branch>`.

### Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VLLM_CI_BRANCH` | ci-infra branch to use for templates (default: `main`) |
| `RUN_ALL` | Force all tests to run |
| `SKIP_TIMEOUT` | Omit configured step timeouts from Python-generated pipelines when set to `1` |
| `NIGHTLY` | Include optional nightly tests |
| `VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED` | Use precompiled wheels (`1`) or build from source (`0`) |
| `COV_ENABLED` | Enable pytest coverage collection and Codecov upload |
| `DOCS_ONLY_DISABLE` | Skip docs-only detection (always run CI) |
| `AMD_MIRROR_HW` | AMD hardware mirror target (default: `amdproduction`) |
| `NOAUTO` | Set to `1` to gate all steps behind manual approval blocks |
| `PRIORITY` | Set to `HIGH` for high-priority pipeline scheduling |

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Enforces YAML validation, Python formatting (ruff), spell checking (typos), and GitHub Actions linting (actionlint).

## Onboarding New Runners

Machines communicate with Buildkite via an agent. Three deployment options:

1. **[Elastic CI Stack](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/elastic-ci-aws/elastic-ci-stack-overview)**: Autoscaling EC2 instances (used by AWS queues).
2. **[K8s Agent Stack](https://github.com/buildkite/agent-stack-k8s)**: Kubernetes-orchestrated agents (used for specialized GPU hardware).
3. **[Standalone Agent](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3)**: Direct installation on existing machines.

All options require a Buildkite agent token and queue name. Contact @khluu on `#sig-ci` ([vllm-dev.slack.com](https://vllm-dev.slack.com)) to obtain credentials.

For standalone agents, add the token and queue to the agent config (typically `/etc/buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg`) and restart the service.
