# vLLM Pipeline Generator

A small tool to dynamically generate Buildkite pipeline for vLLM projects, running on vLLM CI infrastructure.

## Installation

You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vllm-project/ci-infra.git#subdirectory=buildkite/pipeline_generator
```

## Usage

The main entry point is `pipeline-generator`. It requires 2 args:
1. Path to your CI configuration file an output path.
2. Path to the output Buildkite-formatted yaml file.

```bash
pipeline-generator --pipeline_config_path <config.yaml> --output_file_path <output.yaml>
```

### Example

```bash
pipeline-generator --pipeline_config_path pipeline_config.yaml --output_file_path pipeline.yaml
```

## Configuration File Format

The configuration file is a YAML file that defines how the pipeline should be generated.

```yaml
# Name of the pipeline (e.g., vllm_ci)
name: vllm_ci

# List of directories containing step definitions (YAML files)
job_dirs:
  - ".buildkite/test_areas"
  - ".buildkite/image_build"

# List of regex patterns to trigger all tests. If any changed file matches these,
# all steps will be marked to run (overriding individual file dependencies).
run_all_patterns:
  - "docker/Dockerfile"
  - "CMakeLists.txt"
  - "requirements/common.txt"
  - "setup.py"
  - "csrc/"

# List of regex patterns to exclude from run_all_patterns checks.
# If a file matches run_all_patterns but ALSO matches one of these,
# it will NOT trigger a "run all".
run_all_exclude_patterns:
  - "docker/Dockerfile."
  - "csrc/cpu/"

# Container registry to store images
registries: public.ecr.aws/q9t5s3a7

# Repository names for different stages
repositories:
  main: "vllm-ci-postmerge-repo"    # Used for main branch builds
  premerge: "vllm-ci-test-repo"     # Used for PR/pre-merge builds
```

## Environment Variables

The generator relies on several environment variables, typically provided by Buildkite or set by user:

*   `BUILDKITE_BRANCH`: Current branch name.
*   `BUILDKITE_COMMIT`: Current commit hash.
*   `BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST`: Pull request number (or "false").
*   `BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_BASE_BRANCH`: Base branch for PRs.
*   `NIGHTLY`: Set to "1" to auto-run the curated torch-nightly steps (those tagged `mirror.torch_nightly`).
*   `TORCH_NIGHTLY`: Set to "1" to build and run the *entire* test suite against torch nightly (full run, not just the tagged subset). Also forces a full run on the pinned torch. Intended to be set on the scheduled build.
*   `RUN_ALL`: Set to "1" to force run all steps.
*   `SKIP_TIMEOUT`: Set to "1" at pipeline generation time to omit all configured step timeouts.
*   `DOCS_ONLY_DISABLE`: Set to "0" to enable skipping CI for doc-only changes.
*   `VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED`: Set to "1" to force use of precompiled wheels.
*   `VLLM_CI_ONLY_STEP_KEYS`: A non-empty JSON array of stable step keys. When
    set, the generator emits those steps and their transitive dependencies,
    ignoring normal source-file selection. Generated AMD mirror keys such as
    `amd-multi-modal-processor` are accepted and select only the mirror plus
    its AMD dependencies. Unknown keys fail generation.

Kubernetes-backed test jobs read `BUILDKITE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` from the
`buildkite-analytics-token-secret` Secret's `token` key when it is available.
The Secret is optional, so missing credentials do not prevent jobs from running.
Provision it in a Buildkite job namespace with
`infra-k8s/create-buildkite-analytics-secret.sh` to enable test result uploads.

## OpenTelemetry command and test timing

The generator automatically instruments every standard NVIDIA and CPU job in
trusted `vllm-project/vllm` main-branch builds. It injects the helpers in
`otel_helpers/`, emits one
`ci.command` span for each configured command, and loads a pytest plugin that
emits one `pytest.test` child span per test. Job YAML does not need an opt-in
field.

Command and pytest spans are written to an ephemeral local spool while tests
run. An `EXIT` trap uploads the complete job batch once, preserving the job's
original exit status. The exporter has a three-second total network deadline
and the shell enforces a four-second hard stop, so an unavailable telemetry
receiver cannot add an unbounded delay to every command.

Pull-request containers are deliberately excluded from this fine-grained
instrumentation because exporting spans currently requires access to the
Buildkite agent binary to mint a short-lived OIDC token. Mounting that binary
into a container running untrusted PR code would cross the CI trust boundary.
AMD mirrors are also excluded because their remote runtime does not expose the
agent binary. Native Buildkite agent tracing can still cover job phases for
both cases when it is enabled on those agents.
