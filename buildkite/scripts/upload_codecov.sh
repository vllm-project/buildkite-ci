# Coverage Architecture Notes:
# - Tests import vllm from: /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/vllm/ (installed package)
# - Source code exists at: /vllm-workspace/src/vllm/ (for python_only_compile.sh test)
# - Coverage tracks the installed package location during test execution
# - Path mapping in .coveragerc normalizes paths to vllm/ for reporting
