# tpu-inference CI on GKE

TPU steps for the `tpu-inference` suite, run as Kubernetes workloads instead of
on long-lived agent VMs. A Buildkite step on queue `kube` becomes a Kueue
workload, which is admitted against fleet quota on a manager cluster and
dispatched to whichever worker cluster has the chips.

Two clusters, and the split is the whole design:

- **Manager** — `tpu-ci-manager`, Autopilot, `us-central1`. No TPUs. Runs the
  agent-stack-k8s controller, the Buildkite agent pods, and the Kueue that owns
  fleet-wide quota. This is where a step's agent lives and where its log goes.
- **Worker** — `tpu-ci-us-east5`, Standard, `us-east5`. The chips. Reports to
  the manager over Connect Gateway; runs no agent of its own.

MultiKueue joins them: the manager admits, the worker executes. An operator
talks to the manager for almost everything.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `*.tf` | The clusters, node pools, buckets, IAM. Terraform owns infrastructure only. |
| `prod.auto.tfvars` | The fleet. Cluster list, shapes, reservations, versions, timeouts. The single input to both Terraform and the generator. |
| `scripts/generate_manifests.py` | Renders `kueue/generated/` from `prod.auto.tfvars`. |
| `scripts/deploy_manifests.py` | Installs Kueue and JobSet, applies `kueue/generated/`. |
| `kueue/templates/` | The templates the generator renders. |
| `kueue/generated/` | The YAML that actually gets applied. Committed on purpose — see below. |
| `kueue/launcher/` | The program every TPU step runs, its Job, and its image build. |

Terraform stops at the cluster; `deploy_manifests.py` starts there. The
Kubernetes and Helm providers need a reachable API server at plan time, which
would make creating a cluster and configuring it two runs with a hand-edited
variable in between.

`kueue/generated/` is committed so that reviewing a quota change means reading
the YAML that will be applied rather than inferring it from a template.
`deploy_manifests.py` refuses to run if the committed tree differs from a fresh
render, so it doubles as a drift detector.

## Deploying a change

```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt

terraform init && terraform apply          # if any *.tf or the shape list changed
./scripts/generate_manifests.py            # if prod.auto.tfvars or a template changed
./scripts/deploy_manifests.py              # diff, confirm, apply
```

`deploy_manifests.py --mode diff` shows what would change and stops;
`--mode apply` skips the preview and the prompt. It walks the manager first so
its queues exist before a worker reports to them, and it uses its own temporary
kubeconfig, so it will not touch yours or leave a context selected.

Always commit the regenerated `kueue/generated/` alongside whatever produced it.
A change to a comment in a template counts: the comments are rendered into the
ConfigMaps.

## Running a step

Every TPU step invokes one program. The common case is a single pod, and the
step names the hardware:

```yaml
- label: "unit tests"
  agents: { queue: kube }
  command: launch --machine-type ct6e-standard-8t --topology 2x4 -- pytest tests/
```

Anything else — multi-host, disagg, more than one role — brings a manifest, and
states its hardware inside it:

```yaml
  command: launch --manifest .buildkite/kubernetes/manifests/1p1d.yaml
```

and passes nothing else. Not the shape, because a JobSet already says where each
of its pods runs, which no pair of flags can express. Not the command either — a
JobSet has one per role. A manifest passed together with a command is refused
rather than one role being silently chosen.

Every role that holds chips must ask for the same shape: a workload is admitted
against one queue and a queue is one shape. A role that asks for no accelerator
at all is the exception and rides along — a benchmark client driving the servers
over HTTP, say — because the queues put `google.com/tpu` alone under quota.

A manifest must contain a container named `workload`: that is the one whose
output is streamed back and which step environment is forwarded to. More than
one may carry the name, and in a JobSet whose roles all want the log and the
step's secrets, they all should. Everything that follows from the shape is the
launcher's and is rejected in a manifest — the queue label, the gcsfuse cache
size.

How long the workload runs is not one of those. It defaults to
`tpu_test_max_seconds`, which is right for a test, and a manifest that knows
better states its own `activeDeadlineSeconds` — a serving benchmark runs for as
long as its client sweeps, which no shape implies. The ceiling is
`tpu_total_max_seconds`: past that the workload would outlive the launcher
watching it, and the chips would be held by nothing.

`kueue/launcher/launch.py` is the program. It is a file rather than YAML so it
can be linted and run; `deploy_manifests.py` builds the ConfigMap from it.

## Runbook

### Before adding a region

Terraform here owns clusters, not networking. A region needs a Cloud Router and
a Cloud NAT before a private cluster in it can pull from registry.k8s.io, and
neither is declared in this config: a NAT gateway covers every subnet range in
its region and network, so it is shared by everything there rather than owned by
one cluster, and a second gateway over ranges another already claims is refused
at apply.

They are named for the network and the region they serve — `default-us-central1-router`,
`default-us-central1-nat` — and not for this fleet, which merely happens to be
their first tenant.

```bash
gcloud compute routers create default-<region>-router \
  --project cloud-ullm-inference-ci-cd --region <region> --network default
gcloud compute routers nats create default-<region>-nat \
  --project cloud-ullm-inference-ci-cd --region <region> --router default-<region>-router \
  --auto-allocate-nat-external-ips --nat-all-subnet-ip-ranges
```

Check before creating: one may already be there for another tenant.

```bash
gcloud compute routers list --project cloud-ullm-inference-ci-cd
```

### Add a TPU shape

Add it to `tpu_node_pools` for the right cluster in `prod.auto.tfvars`, then
`terraform apply`, `generate_manifests.py`, `deploy_manifests.py`. That creates
the node pool, a ResourceFlavor, a ClusterQueue and a LocalQueue, and puts the
shape in the profile registry the launcher matches against. Steps reach it by
`--machine-type` / `--topology`; there is no new Buildkite queue.

A machine type and a topology together identify a shape, and both are needed: a
2x4 slice of v6e is eight chips either as one `ct6e-standard-8t` or as two
`ct6e-standard-4t`, and which it is decides the host, the pod count and the
quota.

### Rotate the Buildkite agent token

Add a new version to `vllm_buildkite_agent_token` in Secret Manager, then:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deploy/agent-stack-k8s -n buildkite
```

SecretSync polls rather than watches, so the Kubernetes Secret catches up within
about five minutes. **The restart is not optional**: the controller reads the
token once at startup and holds it for the life of the process, so without it
the fleet keeps using the old token until something else restarts the pod.

This is the same secret the bare-metal agents register with. Rotating it affects
both lanes.

### Rebuild the launcher image

Manual, by design — it changes only when the Cloud CLI version does.

```bash
cd kueue/launcher
gcloud builds submit --project cloud-ullm-inference-ci-cd --region us-central1 \
  --config cloudbuild.yaml \
  --gcs-source-staging-dir gs://cloud-ullm-inference-ci-cd-tf-state/cloudbuild-source \
  --substitutions _CLOUD_SDK_VERSION=584.0.0,_REVISION=1 .
```

Then point `launcher_image` in `prod.auto.tfvars` at the new tag and redeploy.
Bump `_REVISION` when the Dockerfile changes without the base image changing, so
a tag always names one set of bytes. The staging directory has to be named: the
default is a multi-region `us` bucket, which `constraints/gcp.resourceLocations`
refuses in this org.

### Tear the fleet down

**Empty the cache buckets first.** They are `force_destroy = false`, so a
`terraform destroy` will fail on them rather than delete them — which is the
intent. Rebuilding the caches from cold costs roughly 2.7x a suite's chips, so
emptying them is a deliberate step and not something a destroy does on the way
past.

There are two per worker cluster — a compilation cache and a model cache — and
their names carry a hash of the cluster's project and region, so list them
rather than typing them:

```bash
terraform state list | grep google_storage_bucket.workload
gcloud storage rm -r 'gs://tpu-ci-cache-*/**' 'gs://tpu-ci-models-*/**'
terraform destroy
```

## Things that will surprise you

**A deploy briefly rejects pod creation, cluster-wide.** Kueue's pod webhooks
are `failurePolicy: Fail` and scoped to every namespace but `kube-system` and
`kueue-system`, with no object selector. While `kueue-controller-manager` rolls,
pod creation anywhere in the cluster fails. It is seconds, and it retries, but
do not deploy into the middle of something that cannot tolerate it. JobSet's
webhooks are also `Fail`, though those are narrowed to pods that already carry a
JobSet label.

**Autopilot writes a nodeAffinity into any podspec that lacks one** —
`cloud.google.com/extended-duration-pods`. MultiKueue copies the podspec to the
worker unchanged, no Standard node carries that label, and the pod is then
unschedulable with nothing reporting an error: the step simply waits out its
timeout. The launcher always states an affinity of its own to prevent it. If you
write a podspec that reaches the worker by some other path, state one too.

**A very short workload can lose its output.** MultiKueue deletes the remote Job
when it completes and the pods go with it, so a workload that lives a few
seconds can be created and removed between two log polls. The launcher polls
faster before the first line arrives, which covers the built-in Job. The step
still passes or fails correctly and says when output is missing; the container
output is in Cloud Logging either way.

**Not every controller setting is in our values.** The effective config is:

```bash
kubectl get cm agent-stack-k8s-config -n buildkite -o jsonpath='{.data.config\.yaml}'
```

`kueue/templates/agent_stack_values.yaml.tpl` sets only the queue and the Secret
name; everything else in that output is a chart or controller default that we
accept, including `job-ttl` and `max-in-flight`. Read it there rather than
guessing — and note the chart pastes our block under keys of its own, so
anything it derives must be left out of the template or the controller's decoder
rejects the duplicate.

## When a step is stuck

Work down from admission. Everything here is on the manager unless it says
otherwise.

```bash
# Is it admitted, and if not, why?
kubectl get workloads -n buildkite
kubectl describe workload -n buildkite <name>

# Is there quota for the shape it asked for?
kubectl get clusterqueue

# Admitted but nothing running: it is on the worker.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials tpu-ci-us-east5 \
  --region us-east5 --project cloud-ullm-inference-ci-cd
kubectl get pods -n buildkite
```

Admission only means the chips are reserved. The pod still has to be scheduled,
the node possibly created from zero, and the image pulled — tens of minutes on a
cold pool. The launcher reports where it is in that gap; a step sitting quietly
at "waiting for a node" is usually the autoscaler, not a fault.

A shape with no node pool is an error at submission that lists the shapes the
fleet does have, rather than a workload queued forever against quota that does
not exist.
