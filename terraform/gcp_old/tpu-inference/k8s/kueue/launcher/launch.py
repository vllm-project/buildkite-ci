"""Submit a TPU workload on behalf of a Buildkite job, then own its lifecycle.

Runs as the command container of an agent-stack-k8s Job in the manager
cluster. Every TPU step goes through here, single pod or not, so there is one
code path and one place where policy lives.

    launch --machine-type ct6e-standard-8t --topology 2x4 -- pytest tests/e2e
    launch --manifest .buildkite/kubernetes/manifests/1p1d.yaml

Why a launcher rather than running the test in this pod: agent-stack-k8s can
only create a batch/v1 Job, and a Job cannot span hosts, so multi-host work
needs something to create a JobSet. Routing the single-pod case through it too
costs one cheap CPU pod and buys two properties that only hold when the agent
is outside the Kueue workload: the agent acquires its Buildkite job in seconds
rather than after admission and node scale-up, so the reservation cannot lapse
and be claimed twice; and preemption evicts the workload without killing the
agent, so a preempted run is a pause in the log rather than a failed build.

The two forms above are the same path with different manifests. Most steps run
one pod on one host, which is the same YAML every time, so the launcher ships
that Job itself and a step gives only the hardware and the command. A step that
needs another arrangement - roles that talk to each other, hosts of one slice -
brings a manifest instead, and that manifest says everything: the hardware,
because a JobSet can hold roles that want chips beside a client that wants none
and no flag here could express that, and the commands, because a JobSet has one
per role and no reading of one command line says which of them it replaces.

So placement is read back out of the manifest rather than taken from a flag.
That is also the only reading that can be checked: a shape the fleet has no
node pool for is refused here, where the profile registry says what the pools
are, instead of queueing forever against quota that does not exist.

A manifest comes from the repo being tested, and so is untrusted. PodSecurity
`baseline` on the workload namespace already rejects privileged containers,
hostPath volumes and host networking, so validation here covers only what
admission cannot know: that the image is from an allowed registry, and that the
workload does not run as the launcher's own identity.
