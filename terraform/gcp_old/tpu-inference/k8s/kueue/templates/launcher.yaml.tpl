# The TPU workload launcher.
#
# Every TPU step runs here: the launcher submits the real workload - a Job for
# single-pod work, a JobSet for anything spanning hosts - and owns its
# lifecycle. The launcher pod is CPU-only and carries no Kueue queue label, so
# Kueue manages only the submitted workload; that is what keeps the Buildkite
# agent alive across preemption and out of the reservation window.
#
# Manager only. MultiKueue is what puts the workload on a worker, and all a
# worker needs from the launcher is log read - launcher_rbac_worker.yaml.tpl.
#
# The program it runs is not here: deploy_manifests.py builds the
# tpu-launcher-scripts ConfigMap from kueue/launcher/launch.py at deploy time,
# so the script exists once, as a file that can be linted and run.

# The hardware the fleet has, and what follows from each shape of it.

# Generated from the same tfvars as the node pools and the queues, so a profile
# cannot describe hardware the fleet does not have. This is what the launcher
# resolves a workload against: which queue admits it, how long it may hold the
# chips, how large its file cache may be - none of which a manifest states.
