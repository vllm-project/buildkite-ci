# One queue per TPU shape, all of a generation's queues in one cohort, so that
# nominalQuota is chips this shape can always have and no other shape can hold
# the reservation against it, while whatever it is not using is lent out.
#
# reclaimWithinCohort stays Never: a lender waits for the borrower's workloads
# to finish rather than evicting them. Eviction returns the accounting at once
# but not the hardware, since eight chips freed across eight single-chip nodes
# still have to scale down before an 8-chip node can boot, and the jobs killed
# to get there have to run again.
