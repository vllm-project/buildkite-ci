# The manager cluster: the one place that is always up. It holds the Buildkite
# controller and the Kueue control plane, and it must hold no accelerators, so
# that nothing running here competes with a test for chips. Worker clusters hold
# the TPUs and attach to this one through Fleet.
#
# Standard, like the workers, because this is where every workload podspec is
# born. Autopilot admission-mutates a podspec it considers underspecified - it
# fills in a nodeAffinity on cloud.google.com/extended-duration-pods for any pod
# that arrives without one - and MultiKueue copies the podspec to a worker
# verbatim, where no node carries that label and the pod is unschedulable with
# nothing reporting an error. A launcher that builds podspecs for another
# cluster cannot share a cluster with something that rewrites them.

# Nodes here are private, so egress - image pulls, Buildkite's API, Secret
# Manager - goes through the Cloud NAT covering this region. It is created
# outside this config, with the rest of the networking; see workers.tf.
